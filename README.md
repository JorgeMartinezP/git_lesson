THIRD Change to the freaking file!


This repository contains the files used for a git lesson

We are adding a change to an existing file that git has already tracked.

FOURTH:  Git is this version control system that prevents us from having "final doc" problem.

This is a commit that I am not aware of, or that I have forgotten about.
